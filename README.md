# Project Title

Creating a Token (Metacrafters Assessment)

# Description

Creating a token using Solidity.
1) We will have some public variables (tokenName, tokenAbbrv, totalSupply)
2) Then we will have a mapping of addresses to balances. (address => uint)
3) After that we will create a mint function, in order to create some tokens (variables => _address, _value)
4) We will then create a burn function, in order to burn some tokens (variables => _address, _value)
5) We will make sure that the number of burnt coins should be less than the total supply by using a conditional statement.

# How to run.

Running the created Solidity program.
1) Go to remix.ethereum.org
2) Create a file with the extension of .sol (eg. Metacrafters.sol)
3) Write the program.
4) Compile the program (Ctrl + s / command + s)
5) Deploy the contract. 
6) After deploying the contract check to see if we are getting the desired output or not by calling the mint and burn functions.
